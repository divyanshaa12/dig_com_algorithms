\textbf{\underline{\LARGE{Task 1}}} \\
The problem  asks us to generate a sampled version of a signal and implement a CTFT function. I choose a signal composed of two tones one sine at 1kHz and other a cosine of 2kHz.\\

Following figure shows the time domain signal and the computed CTFT.\\

%As expected the training error reduces as the number of iterations increases.\\
%It can be seen that regression on raw data performs really good. Apart from the raw data, l2 normalized data provides better results as compared to l1.\\

%Following is the plot of error vs lambda: \\

%Clearly it can be concluded that $\tau = 0.1$ works the best. Apart from that $\tau = 5$ gives good result.\\
%As compared to \textbf{1} the performance of weighted regression is not so good. It can be improved by choosing a suitable lambda parameter.\\

%\textbf{3.} The Implemetation can be found in prob3.m.\\
%The error rate on the data set was found to be 0.1316.\\
